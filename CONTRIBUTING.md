## Pushing to Typst packages

Check out [Typst packages repo](https://github.com/typst/packages) to learn more about packages release pipeline.

I personally suggest the following steps :

- fork the Typst packages repo
- in `packages/preview/polytechnique-reports`, for every `x.y.z` version (if the `main` branch currently contains the `x.y.z` release):

    ```bash
    git subtree pull --prefix=x.y.z git@github.com:remigerme/typst-polytechnique.git main
    ```

- PR your fork to publish the package
